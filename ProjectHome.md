# GenPro #
_Genetic Programming made simple_

Genetic programming (GP) is the art of generating a program which adheres to a given set of test cases. One could say that it’s the ultimate in test-driven development: writing the code is done for you.
GP can be used for curve fitting, optimization, data mining and more. For example: you can generate a program which predicts the number of attendees to a conference presentation based on: the fame of the speaker, the company size of the speaker, the track, the fame of the subject, etc.

The aim of GenPro is to add Genetic Programming (GP) to the developer’s general toolbox. This opposed to where GP mostly is exercised: at academic levels with long learning curves, complex programming and cumbersome extension work.

The innovation GenPro brings is that it uses reflection for it’s inner working. This allows for absolutely easy extending: through POJO's. And the solutions it generates are in plain javacode.

The examples show how to define inputs and outputs, create a testset and a fitness-function for a given problem in less than 60 lines of code.
Feeding it with your own extension (e.g. function) takes an extra 5 lines of plain java code.

At November 11, 2009 a [presentation](http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jfall_2009/sessions/00038/) about GenPro was given at the [NLJUG](http://www.nljug.org/) (Dutch java-usergroup) [J-Fall conference](http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jfall_2009/).
About 90 people were present, feedback was positive.

In October 2009 a presentation on GenPro was given to the [JavaKnights](http://www.justobjects.nl/javaknights.html) a Dutch Java Freelance community.
